📊 Key Insights

Revenue Growth: Driven by a small set of categories and regions.

Delivery Performance: Delays strongly impact customer ratings; on-time % dips during high-volume periods.

Seller Risk: Minority of sellers responsible for majority of SLA breaches. Stars set benchmarks; At Risk sellers need targeted intervention.

Freight Cost: Distance and category influence shipping cost; high-distance categories have optimization potential.

Customer Experience: Timely delivery directly correlates with satisfaction; delayed orders consistently lower ratings.

🧠 Strategic Takeaways

Focus on high-revenue sellers with poor SLA for operational improvement.

Optimize high-distance freight and category-specific shipping strategies.

Monitor top-performing categories to maintain revenue growth while improving delivery reliability.

Use quadrant segmentation to guide seller management and SLA enforcement.
